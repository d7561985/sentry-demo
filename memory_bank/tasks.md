## Task Log
- 2025-06-21: VAN mode initiated
- 2025-06-21: Memory Bank structure created
- 2025-06-21: All Memory Bank files initialized
- 2025-06-21: VAN mode completed successfully
- 2025-06-21: IMPLEMENT mode - Scenario 1 completed
- 2025-06-21: REFLECT mode - Analysis completed
- 2025-06-21: ARCHIVE mode - Scenario 1 archived to docs/archive/

## Scenario 1: COMPLETED ✅
Archive: `/docs/archive/2025-06-21_scenario1_distributed_tracing.md`

## VAN Corrections Applied
- Refocused on POC scenarios, not business logic
- Simplified to MongoDB + Redis only
- Scenario-driven development approach
- Each service exists to demo Sentry features

## Next Phase Decision
Project complexity assessment: SIMPLIFIED
- Scenario-based implementation
- Minimal business logic
- Focus on Sentry demo value
- Clear implementation path

**Recommendation: Proceed directly to IMPLEMENT mode**
Start with Scenario 1: Distributed Tracing
