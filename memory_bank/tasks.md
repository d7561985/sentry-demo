## Task Log
- 2025-06-21: VAN mode initiated
- 2025-06-21: Memory Bank structure created
- 2025-06-21: All Memory Bank files initialized
- 2025-06-21: VAN mode completed successfully
- 2025-06-21: IMPLEMENT mode - Scenario 1 completed
- 2025-06-21: REFLECT mode - Analysis completed
- 2025-06-21: ARCHIVE mode - Scenario 1 archived to docs/archive/
- 2025-06-22: VAN mode - Added animated slot machine UI

## Scenario 1: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
Archive: `/docs/archive/2025-06-21_scenario1_distributed_tracing.md`

## VAN Corrections Applied
- Refocused on POC scenarios, not business logic
- Simplified to MongoDB + Redis only
- Scenario-driven development approach
- Each service exists to demo Sentry features
- Simple CSS-only animated slot machine (no complex engines)

## Frontend Enhancement Details
- Three-reel slot machine with CSS animation (3 reels in a row)
- Symbols scroll from top to bottom in continuous strip
- Fast animation speed (0.1s per cycle)
- Sequential symbol display (üçíüçãüçäüçá‚≠êüíé) without overlapping
- Seamless loop with duplicated symbol strip
- Displays actual result symbols after API response
- Simple bounce animation for wins
- Aesthetic design with dark theme and glow effects
- No external libraries or complex state management

## Next Phase Decision
Project complexity assessment: SIMPLIFIED
- Scenario-based implementation
- Minimal business logic
- Focus on Sentry demo value
- Clear implementation path

**Recommendation: Test frontend changes, then proceed to next scenario**
Start with Scenario 2: Error Tracking Suite
