# Sentry POC - Summary of Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Errors
- **npm ci errors**: Changed all Dockerfiles from `npm ci` to `npm install` due to missing package-lock.json files
- **Node.js version**: Used Node.js 14-alpine as specified in techContext.md
- **MongoDB driver**: Downgraded from v6 to v5 for Node.js 14 compatibility

### 2. Frontend Issues
- **@sentry/angular version**: Downgraded from v8 to v7 for Angular 13 compatibility
- **process.env error**: Removed process.env references (not available in browser)
- **API URL**: Fixed double `/api/api/` path issue by setting apiUrl to empty string in production

### 3. Go Services Issues
- **Sentry SDK API changes**: Fixed `span.ToSentryTrace()` usage for v0.29.1
- **EnableTracing**: Added `EnableTracing: true` to Sentry initialization
- **klauspost/compress**: Added replace directive for Go 1.18 compatibility

### 4. Payment Service Issues
- **Sentry v8 API**: Updated to use proper v8 API methods:
  - Removed `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations`
  - Fixed span creation and transaction handling
  - Added proper trace continuation

### 5. Distributed Tracing
- **Frontend**: Added proper sentry-trace and baggage headers
- **API Gateway**: Added baggage header propagation to downstream services
- **Payment Service**: Implemented trace continuation from upstream
- **Python Service**: Already had proper trace continuation

## Current Status
All services are now building and running correctly with distributed tracing enabled. The system demonstrates:
- End-to-end transaction tracing across microservices
- Proper error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring with intentional bottlenecks for demo purposes

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Open http://localhost:4200
2. Click "SPIN" button to trigger distributed traces
3. Check Sentry dashboard for trace visualization
