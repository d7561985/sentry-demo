# PLATFORM AWARENESS SYSTEM

> **TL;DR:** This system detects the operating system, path format, and shell environment, then adapts commands accordingly to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## üîç PLATFORM DETECTION PROCESS

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start["Start Platform<br>Detection"] --> DetectOS["Detect OS<br>Environment"]
    DetectOS --> Windows["Windows<br>Detection"]
    DetectOS --> Mac["macOS<br>Detection"]
    DetectOS --> Linux["Linux<br>Detection"]
    
    Windows & Mac & Linux --> PathCheck["Path Separator<br>Detection"]
    PathCheck --> CmdAdapt["Command<br>Adaptation"]
    CmdAdapt --> ShellCheck["Shell Type<br>Detection"]
    ShellCheck --> Complete["Platform Detection<br>Complete"]
```

## üìã PLATFORM DETECTION IMPLEMENTATION

For reliable platform detection:

```
## Platform Detection Results
Operating System: [Windows/macOS/Linux]
Path Separator: [\ or /]
Shell Environment: [PowerShell/Bash/Zsh/Cmd]
Command Adaptation: [Required/Not Required]

Adapting commands for [detected platform]...
```

## üîç PATH FORMAT CONVERSION

When converting paths between formats:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Input as Path Input
    participant Detector as Format Detector
    participant Converter as Format Converter
    participant Output as Adapted Path
    
    Input->>Detector: Raw Path
    Detector->>Detector: Detect Current Format
    Detector->>Converter: Path + Current Format
    Converter->>Converter: Apply Target Format
    Converter->>Output: Platform-Specific Path
```

## üìù PLATFORM VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

```
‚úì PLATFORM VERIFICATION
- Operating system correctly identified? [YES/NO]
- Path separator format detected? [YES/NO]
- Shell environment identified? [YES/NO]
- Command set adapted appropriately? [YES/NO]
- Path format handling configured? [YES/NO]

‚Üí If all YES: Platform adaptation complete
‚Üí If any NO: Run additional detection steps
```
