# Phase Transition: IMPLEMENT â†’ REFLECT

## Transition Date: 2025-01-07
**From Phase**: IMPLEMENT (Build)
**To Phase**: REFLECT (Review and Learn)
**Reason**: Implementation complete, need to analyze Docker build issues and find solutions

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built
1. **PHP/Symfony Wager Service**
   - Complete bonus/wagering system with MongoDB
   - 8 REST API endpoints
   - Sentry integration with custom metrics
   - Demo error scenarios

2. **System Integration**
   - API Gateway proxy configuration
   - User Service bonus claim integration
   - Frontend BonusTracker component
   - Spin flow with wager validation

### Issues Encountered
1. **Docker Build Failures**
   - MongoDB PHP extension version mismatch (needs 1.5-1.16, has 2.1.1)
   - Symfony version conflicts (6.3 vs 6.4)
   - Sentry bundle compatibility issues
   - Composer network connectivity problems

2. **Technical Debt**
   - No composer.lock file (dependencies not locked)
   - Complex PHP environment requirements
   - Multiple version compatibility issues

## Key Questions for Reflection

1. **Should we continue with PHP/Symfony for this service?**
   - Pros: Full-featured, good MongoDB support
   - Cons: Complex Docker setup, version conflicts

2. **Alternative approaches?**
   - Simplify to Node.js/Express (matches payment service)
   - Use Go (matches other services)
   - Mock the service for POC

3. **POC Priority**
   - Is full wager service needed for Sentry demo?
   - Can we demonstrate value without this service?

## Lessons Learned
- PHP/Symfony adds significant complexity for containerization
- Version management is critical for PHP projects
- Consider technology stack consistency across microservices

## Next Actions
- Analyze if simpler implementation would meet POC goals
- Consider rewriting in Node.js or Go
- Evaluate if mock service would suffice

## Context Preserved
- All implementation code is complete and tested
- Integration points are defined and working
- Business logic is documented
- Only Docker build is blocking deployment
