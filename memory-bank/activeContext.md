Current Phase: REFLECT
Previous Phase: IMPLEMENT
Task Focus: N+1 Query Enhancement for Sentry Detection
Complexity Level: 2
Start Time: 2025-01-06
End Time: 2025-01-06

## Current Implementation Status
### Debug-ID Integration ✅
- Successfully implemented Sentry debug-ids for source map handling
- Updated upload-sourcemaps.sh to use debug-id injection approach
- Created comprehensive documentation for auth token setup
- Addressed user's PROJECT_ID confusion with clear documentation
- Created development build script without source map uploads
- Successfully tested debug-id injection on production build

## Implementation Details
### Build Configuration ✅
- Source maps properly generated with Angular 20 esbuild
- Debug-ids injected into 4 JavaScript files and their source maps
- Each file has unique debug-id (e.g., 60e02648-3dc2-50e9-8202-a5f915fd9395)

### Documentation Created ✅
1. **services/frontend/README.md**
   - Auth token creation steps
   - PROJECT_ID clarification
   - CI/CD integration examples
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **services/frontend/.env.example**
   - Detailed comments about PROJECT vs folder name
   - Clear examples of how to find PROJECT slug

3. **Main README.md**
   - Added section for creating Sentry Auth Token

### Scripts Updated ✅
1. **upload-sourcemaps.sh**
   - Complete rewrite for debug-id approach
   - Injection step: `npx @sentry/cli sourcemaps inject`
   - Upload step: `npx @sentry/cli sourcemaps upload`

2. **build-dev.sh**
   - Created for development builds without uploads
   - Addresses user's concern about @start-dev.sh

## Testing Results
- Production build: ✅ Successful
- Debug-id injection: ✅ 4 files modified
- Source map generation: ✅ All maps include debug_id field
- Script validation: ✅ Dry run successful (requires auth token)

## Remaining Tasks
- Test with actual Sentry credentials
- Verify error tracking works with debug-ids in Sentry dashboard
