   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@15 @angular/core@15
   - [ ] Migrate to standalone components (optional)
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 4.8.x
   - [ ] Test application functionality

3. Angular 15 → 16 Migration
   - [ ] Update to Angular 16
   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@16 @angular/core@16
   - [ ] Convert to signals (where applicable)
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 5.0.x
   - [ ] Test application functionality

4. Angular 16 → 17 Migration
   - [ ] Update to Angular 17
   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@17 @angular/core@17
   - [ ] Migrate to new control flow syntax (@if, @for)
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 5.2.x
   - [ ] Test application functionality

5. Angular 17 → 18 Migration
   - [ ] Update to Angular 18
   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@18 @angular/core@18
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 5.4.x
   - [ ] Test application functionality

6. Angular 18 → 19 Migration
   - [ ] Update to Angular 19
   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@19 @angular/core@19
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 5.5.x
   - [ ] Test application functionality

7. Angular 19 → 20 Migration
   - [ ] Update to Angular 20
   - [ ] Run ng update @angular/cli@20 @angular/core@20
   - [ ] Update TypeScript to 5.8.x
   - [ ] Complete final migration steps

### Phase 3: Code Modernization
1. Standalone Components Migration
   - [ ] Run standalone migration schematic
   - [ ] Convert app.module.ts to bootstrapApplication
   - [ ] Update component imports

2. Control Flow Syntax Migration
   - [ ] Run control flow migration schematic
   - [ ] Replace *ngIf with @if
   - [ ] Replace *ngFor with @for
   - [ ] Replace *ngSwitch with @switch

3. Signals Migration
   - [ ] Run signals migration schematic
   - [ ] Convert @Input() to input signals
   - [ ] Convert @Output() to output signals
   - [ ] Update component logic for signals

4. Build System Migration
   - [ ] Migrate from webpack to esbuild
   - [ ] Update angular.json configuration
   - [ ] Optimize build performance

### Phase 4: Sentry Integration Update
1. Update Sentry SDK
   - [ ] Update @sentry/angular to latest version
   - [ ] Update @sentry/tracing to latest version
   - [ ] Verify Sentry initialization compatibility
   - [ ] Test error tracking functionality
   - [ ] Update source map upload process

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation
1. Comprehensive Testing
   - [ ] Run unit tests
   - [ ] Run e2e tests (if available)
   - [ ] Manual functionality testing
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Sentry integration testing

## Creative Phases Required
- [x] Component Architecture Review - Full standalone migration design completed
- [x] State Management Design - Hybrid Signals + RxJS strategy defined
- [x] Template Modernization - Control flow syntax migration planned
- [x] Build Optimization Strategy - esbuild configuration designed
- [x] Post-Migration Enhancements - Advanced Angular 20 features designed

## Dependencies
- Node.js 20.x+ (runtime requirement)
- TypeScript 5.8.x (language requirement)
- @angular/cli latest version
- @sentry/angular latest version
- All Angular migration schematics

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge 1: Breaking changes across 7 major versions**
  - Mitigation: Sequential updates with testing at each step
  
- **Challenge 2: Control flow syntax changes**
  - Mitigation: Use automated migration schematics
  
- **Challenge 3: Signals API adoption**
  - Mitigation: Gradual migration, starting with new components
  
- **Challenge 4: Build system migration**
  - Mitigation: Test esbuild compatibility early
  
- **Challenge 5: Sentry SDK compatibility**
  - Mitigation: Verify compatibility at each major version

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Application functionality regression
- **Medium Risk**: Build performance issues
- **Low Risk**: Development environment setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application runs on Angular 20
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Sentry integration functional
- [ ] Build time improved with esbuild
- [ ] No runtime errors in console
