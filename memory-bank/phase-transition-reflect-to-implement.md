# Phase Transition: REFLECT â†’ IMPLEMENT

## Transition Date: 2025-01-07
**From Phase**: REFLECT (Review and Learn)
**To Phase**: IMPLEMENT (Build)
**Reason**: Decision made to upgrade to Symfony 7 instead of changing tech stack

## Reflection Outcome

### Decision: Upgrade to Symfony 7
- Keeps PHP/Symfony in the tech stack as requested
- Solves version compatibility issues
- Preserves all implemented business logic
- Modern framework with better dependency support

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update composer.json**
   - Symfony packages to 7.*
   - Sentry bundle to latest
   - MongoDB ODM to version compatible with ext-mongodb 2.1.1

2. **Fix Configuration**
   - Update deprecated configurations
   - Adapt to Symfony 7 changes

3. **Test Docker Build**
   - Ensure all dependencies resolve
   - Verify service starts correctly

## Context from Reflection
- PHP implementation is complete and correct
- Only Docker/dependency issues need fixing
- Symfony 7 should resolve version conflicts
