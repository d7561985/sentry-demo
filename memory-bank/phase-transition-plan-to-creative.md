# Phase Transition: PLAN â†’ CREATIVE

## Transition Date: 2025-01-07
## From: PLAN (Planning & Architecture)
## To: CREATIVE (Design & Decision Making)

## PLAN Phase Summary

### Completed Planning
1. **Implementation Timeline**: 4-day plan created
2. **API Contracts**: 5 endpoints defined
3. **Integration Sequence**: Service communication flow mapped
4. **Technology Stack**: PHP 8.2, Symfony 6.3, MongoDB selected
5. **Sentry Integration Points**: Error scenarios and metrics identified

### Key Decisions Made
- Port 8085 for Wager Service
- REST API pattern (consistent with other services)
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Simple 2x wagering multiplier
- Auto-claim welcome bonus on user creation

## Context for CREATIVE Phase

### Design Challenges Requiring Creative Solutions

1. **Architecture Design**
   - How to structure the PHP/Symfony service?
   - Service layer vs. repository pattern?
   - Event-driven vs. synchronous updates?

2. **Algorithm Design**
   - How to calculate wagering progress?
   - How to handle concurrent wagers?
   - When to convert bonus to real money?

3. **Data Model Design**
   - Separate collections vs. embedded documents?
   - How to track wager history efficiently?
   - Indexing strategy for performance?

4. **Integration Patterns**
   - Synchronous vs. asynchronous communication?
   - Error handling and retry strategies?
   - Transaction consistency across services?

### Creative Constraints
- KISS principle - keep it simple for POC
- Must demonstrate Sentry capabilities
- Performance must be reasonable
- Code should be maintainable

## Artifacts from PLAN Phase
- `plan-wager-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation plan
- API endpoint specifications
- Service integration flow diagram
- 4-day timeline with milestones

## CREATIVE Phase Goals
1. Design optimal architecture for PHP/Symfony service
2. Create efficient algorithms for bonus/wager calculations
3. Design performant MongoDB schema
4. Define integration patterns with existing services
5. Plan Sentry-specific demonstrations

## Success Criteria for CREATIVE Phase
- [ ] Architecture decision with rationale
- [ ] Algorithm flowcharts for key operations
- [ ] MongoDB schema with indexes defined
- [ ] Integration sequence diagrams
- [ ] List of Sentry demo scenarios
