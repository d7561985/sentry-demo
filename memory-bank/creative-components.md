# Creative Phase Components Analysis

## Components Requiring Creative Phase Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture Review
**Current State**: Traditional NgModule-based architecture with 3 components
**Migration Decision Required**: 
- Convert to standalone components pattern
- Determine component import strategy
- Plan module decomposition approach

**Components Affected**:
- AppComponent (root component)
- SlotMachineComponent (game feature)
- BusinessMetricsComponent (analytics feature)

### 2. State Management Design
**Current State**: Service-based state management with GameService
**Migration Decision Required**:
- Adopt Angular Signals for reactive state
- Determine signal vs observable patterns
- Plan migration strategy for existing services

**Services Affected**:
- GameService (HTTP calls, state management)
- SentryErrorHandler (error handling)

### 3. Template Syntax Modernization
**Current State**: Legacy structural directives (*ngIf, *ngFor)
**Migration Decision Required**:
- Control flow syntax adoption strategy (@if, @for)
- Template migration approach
- Performance optimization considerations

### 4. Routing Architecture
**Current State**: Basic RouterModule configuration
**Migration Decision Required**:
- Lazy loading strategy for routes
- Standalone router configuration
- Route guards modernization

### 5. Dependency Injection Pattern
**Current State**: Constructor-based injection
**Migration Decision Required**:
- inject() function adoption strategy
- Provider configuration for standalone
- Backward compatibility approach

## Creative Phase Requirements Summary

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
- [ ] Standalone component migration strategy
- [ ] Module decomposition plan
- [ ] Import optimization approach

### Phase 2: State Management Design
- [ ] Signal adoption strategy
- [ ] Service modernization plan
- [ ] Reactive patterns design

### Phase 3: Template Modernization
- [ ] Control flow syntax adoption
- [ ] Performance optimization strategy
- [ ] Migration tooling approach

### Recommendation
Given the architectural changes required for Angular 20, a CREATIVE phase is recommended before implementation to design:
1. Component architecture transformation strategy
2. State management modernization approach
3. Template syntax migration plan
4. Build optimization configuration

These design decisions will significantly impact the implementation phase and require careful planning to ensure a smooth migration.
