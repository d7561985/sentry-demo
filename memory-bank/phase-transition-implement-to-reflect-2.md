# Phase Transition: IMPLEMENT â†’ REFLECT

## Transition Date: 2025-01-07
**From Phase**: IMPLEMENT (Build)
**To Phase**: REFLECT (Review and Learn)
**Reason**: Wager Service implementation complete, need to review outcomes and production issues

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Completed
1. **PHP/Symfony 7.3 Wager Service**
   - Upgraded from Symfony 6.4 to 7.3 (latest stable)
   - Fixed all dependency compatibility issues
   - Docker build successful
   - All 8 API endpoints implemented
   - Sentry integration configured

2. **Integration Points**
   - API Gateway routes configured
   - User Service bonus claim integration
   - Frontend BonusTracker component
   - Spin flow with wager validation

### Key Decisions
- Kept PHP/Symfony stack instead of rewriting in Node.js
- Upgraded to latest Symfony 7.3
- Fixed Sentry SDK configuration for v4.x

## Issues to Reflect On

1. **Production Build Script**
   - User reports issues with `start-prod.sh`
   - Need to investigate what's failing

2. **Version Management**
   - Production build process may have issues
   - Source map upload process needs review

## Context Preserved
- All implementation complete and tested
- Docker builds successfully
- Integration points defined
- Production deployment issues need investigation
