# Phase Transition: VAN â†’ PLAN

## Transition Date: 2025-01-07
## From: VAN (Verification & Analysis)
## To: PLAN (Planning & Architecture)

## VAN Phase Summary

### Completed Analysis
1. **Architecture Review**: Identified where PHP/Symfony service fits
2. **Requirements Clarification**: 
   - Welcome bonus: 1000 credits
   - Wagering requirement: 2x (2000 total)
   - Auto-claim on first visit
   - Progress tracking needed
3. **Integration Points**: Mapped connections to all existing services
4. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Port 8085 for new service
   - MongoDB for data storage
   - REST API pattern
   - Sentry integration required

### Key Insights
- Need to modify user creation flow to trigger bonus
- Wager validation must happen before game calculation
- Balance updates need careful coordination
- Frontend requires new UI components

## Context for PLAN Phase

### Priority Tasks
1. Create detailed implementation plan
2. Design API contracts
3. Plan database schema
4. Define integration sequence
5. Plan frontend modifications

### Technical Constraints
- Must follow existing microservice patterns
- Keep complexity low (POC/KISS)
- Ensure Sentry visibility throughout
- Maintain distributed tracing

### Risk Areas
- Service coordination complexity
- Balance consistency across services
- Concurrent wager handling
- Bonus expiration logic (simplified for POC)

## Artifacts to Carry Forward
- `van-wager-analysis.md` - Complete analysis document
- Architecture integration diagram
- Proposed API endpoints
- Data model design

## PLAN Phase Goals
1. Break down implementation into manageable tasks
2. Define clear API contracts between services
3. Create implementation sequence
4. Identify potential demo scenarios
5. Plan Sentry integration points
