# Task Reflection: Sentry Independent Traces Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented independent transaction traces for the Angular frontend using Sentry SDK v9.35.0. The solution allows each user action to create its own separate trace instead of being nested within pageload/navigation transactions. Also addressed the infinite replay recording issue by adding proper configuration limits.

## What Went Well
- **Quick Problem Identification**: Testing different trace creation methods (forceTransaction, startNewTrace, parentSpan: null) helped identify that only `startNewTrace()` works correctly
- **Clean Utility Implementation**: Created reusable `sentry-traces.ts` utility with:
  - `createNewTrace()` function for independent transactions
  - Standard transaction naming conventions
  - Proper error handling with `setTransactionStatus()`
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Updated all user actions in both SlotMachineComponent and BusinessMetricsComponent
- **Replay Fix**: Successfully addressed the infinite recording issue by setting `maxReplayDuration: 60000`

## Challenges
- **SDK Documentation Gap**: The Sentry SDK v9 documentation doesn't clearly explain that `startNewTrace()` is the only reliable method for creating independent transactions
- **TypeScript Issues**: 
  - `startNewTrace()` doesn't accept options parameter (only callback)
  - SpanStatus requires numeric codes instead of string values
- **Replay Configuration**: The infinite recording behavior wasn't immediately obvious - required adding duration limits

## Lessons Learned
- **Always Test Multiple Approaches**: Testing forceTransaction, startNewTrace, and parentSpan:null revealed that only one method works as expected
- **SDK Version Matters**: Behavior changed significantly between Sentry SDK v7 and v9
- **TypeScript Types Can Be Misleading**: The type definitions suggested features that don't actually work (like options for startNewTrace)
- **Replay Needs Explicit Limits**: Default replay duration can be too long (60 minutes), setting explicit limits prevents issues

## Process Improvements
- **Create Test Components Early**: The SentryTestComponent was invaluable for validating different approaches
- **Check Console Output**: Browser console diagnostics helped identify the replay issue quickly
- **Use Descriptive Transaction Names**: Established naming convention (e.g., `user-action.slot-machine.spin`) makes traces easy to find

## Technical Improvements
- **Better Error Context**: All traces now include relevant attributes (user.id, bet.amount, debug.type, etc.)
- **Consistent Pattern**: All user actions follow the same pattern using `createNewTrace()`
- **Proper Status Handling**: Using numeric status codes (1 for OK, 2 for ERROR) instead of strings
- **Replay Controls**: Added manual controls (stop/start/flush) for better debugging

## Next Steps
- Monitor the replay recordings to ensure the 1-minute limit is appropriate for the demo
- Consider adding more custom attributes to traces for better insights
- Document the trace naming conventions in the project README
- Consider creating traces for other user interactions (navigation, form submissions, etc.)

## Cleanup Completed
- ✅ Removed SentryTestComponent from app.component.ts
- ✅ Deleted /components/sentry-test directory
- ✅ Removed test-sentry-replay.html
- ✅ Removed testIndependentTransaction function from utils
- ✅ Removed diagnostic code from main.ts
- ✅ All test artifacts have been cleaned up
