# Angular 13 to 20 Migration Plan Summary

## PLANNING COMPLETE

✅ Implementation plan created
✅ Technology stack validated
✅ tasks.md updated with plan
✅ Challenges and mitigations documented
✅ Creative phases identified (for Level 3)

## Plan Overview

### Migration Strategy
- **Approach**: Sequential major version updates (13→14→15→16→17→18→19→20)
- **Duration**: Estimated 5-7 phases with testing at each step
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High due to 7 major version jumps

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Build System**: Migrate from webpack to esbuild
2. **Component Architecture**: Convert to standalone components
3. **State Management**: Adopt Angular Signals
4. **Template Syntax**: Migrate to new control flow (@if, @for)
5. **Dependency Injection**: Use inject() function pattern

### Creative Phase Requirements
Due to significant architectural changes, the following components require creative design decisions:
1. **Component Architecture** - Standalone migration strategy
2. **State Management** - Signals adoption approach
3. **Template Modernization** - Control flow syntax migration
4. **Build Optimization** - esbuild configuration

### Technology Stack (Target)
- Angular 20.0.x
- Node.js 20.19.0+
- TypeScript 5.8.x
- RxJS 7.x
- @angular-devkit/build-angular (esbuild)

### Next Steps
→ NEXT RECOMMENDED MODE: CREATIVE MODE

The creative phase is needed to design the architectural transformation strategy before beginning implementation. This will ensure a smooth migration path and optimal use of Angular 20 features.
